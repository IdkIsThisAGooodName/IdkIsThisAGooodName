### Hey there 👋 I'm Daniel!

I'm a high school student who loves building cool things, especially when space is involved 🌌🚀  
Currently learning, experimenting, and occasionally causing **galaxies to collide** (virtually, of course).

---

🛠️ **Projects**  
🔭 [Galaxy Collision Simulator](https://github.com/IdkIsThisAGooodName/GalaxyCollisionSimulator)  
Ever wondered what happens when galaxies crash into each other? I did. **So I coded it.** 

(No alien alien civilisations were harmed in the making of this project.)

🚧 **More projects coming soon**  
(assuming I survive my exams and don’t get gravitationally pulled into a black hole of homework)

---

🧠 **Learning**  
- Python (my go-to tool for chaos)  
- Pygame (because space needs graphics)  
- Physics & Astronomy (yes, I'm that kind of nerd)  

---
😶‍🌫️ **Beyond Coding**
- Tennis Enthusiast 🎾 - keeps me on my toes (and off my desk) 
- Avid Reader 📚 - always escaping into other worlds (mostly fantasy)
- Playing Piano 🎹 - crafting melodies as smoothly as i write code (my code almost never works)
--- 

🎲 **Fun facts**  
- I like space, code, and sometimes combining both  
- My code occasionally works on the *first try* ... and thats both a miracle a mystery (sometimes terrifying)
- Always open to cool ideas and collabs

📬 **Get in touch**

Let’s make something amazing — or at least something that doesn’t crash 😄
